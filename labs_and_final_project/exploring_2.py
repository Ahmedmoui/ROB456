# This assignment lets you both define a strategy for picking the next point to explore and determine how you
#  want to chop up a full path into way points. You'll need path_planning.py as well (for calculating the paths)
#
# Note that there isn't a "right" answer for either of these. This is (mostly) a light-weight way to check
#  your code for obvious problems before trying it in ROS. It's set up to make it easy to download a map and
#  try some robot starting/ending points
#
# Given to you:
#   Image handling
#   plotting
#   Some structure for keeping/changing waypoints and converting to/from the map to the robot's coordinate space
